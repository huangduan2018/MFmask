# MFmask
 The software called MFmask is used for automated clouds, cloud shadows, and snow masking for Landsat 4-8 images. The MFmask is developed by integrating Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data into the existing Fmask algorithm (Version 3.3; https://github.com/prs021/fmask). It is specifically designed for Landsat images acquired from mountainous area well (thereafter we call this algorithm MFmask, in which the letter “M” refers to mountainous). 
 
 The MFmask can provide cloud and cloud shadow detection at similar (or slightly better) accuracy than Fmask for flat places, and can provide substantial higher accuracy than Fmask for mountainous areas.
